  ## Description
  A relatively simple back-end for an e-commerce site created with Node.js by taking a functional Express API and using the Sequelize ORM library to interact with a MySQL database. Users can interact with the database using CRUD methods to view, create, update, and delete products, product categories, and product tags.

  ## Installation
  To install, simply clone the repository and use command prompt "npm install". Express, dotenv, mysql2, and sequelize are required, but are included as dependencies in the package.json file. Example seeds have been provided for reference/testing purposes, use the command "npm run seed" to re-seed the database. Launch the sever with the command "npm start". 

  ## Usage
  Once the database has been populated and the sever is running, CRUD routes can be utilized with Insomnia.

  ## Contributing
  Anything available for open-source contributions will be listed on the GitHub repository Issues page and marked accordingly.

  ## Tests
  Routes can be tested with Insomnia. No other tests available at this time.
