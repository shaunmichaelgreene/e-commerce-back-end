  ## Description
  A relatively simple back-end for an e-commerce site created with Node.js by taking a functional Express API and using the Sequelize ORM library to interact with a MySQL database. Users can interact with the database using CRUD methods to view, create, update, and delete products, product categories, and product tags.
